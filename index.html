                <p class="text-small">Education develops critical thinking. This is vital in teaching a person how to use logic when making decisions and interacting with people (e.g., boosting creativity, enhancing time management). Education helps an individual meet basic job qualifications and makes them more likely to secure better jobs.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is a program for children whose native language is not English. Children are taught in several languages such as Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, French Creole, just to name a few. Bilingual education has set two important goals. The first goal is the development of academic English and school success. The second goal is to develop the heritage language. When schools provide children with an education in their primary language, the children are less likely to fall behind in the areas of Math, Science, and Social Studies. Just knowing English will not help the student unless thy also gain knowledge in other subject areas, which is best accomplished through bilingual education.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The Federal government passed the Bilingual Education Act in 1968. This Act provided funding to any district that would integrate English and the native language of the student in the classrooms. All around the country issues have come up concerning bilingual education. Some policy makers, taxpayers, and even many educators believe that bilingual education is not effective (Bilingual Research Journal on Line). They believe that the funding for this program is too expensive. In this case, money is used as a reason for not wanting a program that helps students. Opponents of bilingual education clearly do not see the advantages this program brings to our growing population of non-English speakers. Many do not realize the benefit that bilingual education can bring to a student who is a non-English speaker. I am one of those non-English speakers, who benefited from bilingual education.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> In an effort to improve universal access to education, the ministry of education made a decision to introduce the re-entry policy. The policy is meant to accord girls who drop out of school owing to early pregnancy an opportunity to be re-admitted six months to one after delivery. This initiative has since scored a number of successes as some girls have gone back to school and successfully completed their secondary education , though some, order the age initially would have done so, Fifth National Development Plan(2006-2010). Before October 13 1997, it was considered an expellable offence for girls who fell pregnant while at school..</p>
